🚀 DSA & CP Master Repository
20 Essential DSA Patterns • Competitive Programming Essentials • 600+ Solved Problems

Welcome to my DSA + Competitive Programming repository!
This repo is a complete learning + revision hub created after solving 600+ problems across platforms.
It contains the 20 most important DSA patterns, hand-crafted explanations, and clean implementations—along with high-value CP topics like Number Theory, Bit Manipulation, and more.

🔥 Why This Repository?

Most learners struggle with where to start and what to practice.
This repo gives you:

✔️ A pattern-based roadmap followed by top contestants & FAANG engineers

✔️ Clean, concise implementations of core DSA fundamentals

✔️ CP-oriented snippets & formulas

✔️ Interview-ready patterns for SDE-I roles

✔️ All code beginner-friendly but scalable for advanced use

If you’re preparing for product-based company interviews or enhancing your competitive programming skills, this repo is for you.
