🎯 Summary: What You Should Master for PayU

PayU most frequently asks:
Arrays (two pointers, hashing, prefix-sum)
Strings (parsing, substring problems, palindrome, isomorphic)
Sliding window
Linked lists
Trees (traversals + LCA)
Stack & monotonic stack
Medium-level DP
Implementation-heavy coding

If you finish the above 55 problems, you're prepared not only for PayU, but also Atlassian, Rippling, Nutanix, Uber, 
Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta and most top product-based companies.
